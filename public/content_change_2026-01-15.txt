Why This Matters

Greater Moncton faces a visible homelessness crisis disproportionately severe compared to major Canadian cities. As of August 2024, 511 individuals are experiencing chronic homelessness in our community.

GMHSC works tirelessly to coordinate services, but lacks the technology infrastructure to maximize their impact. Every improvement in coordination means faster, more effective support for vulnerable community members.

Your solution will have measurable impact on real lives.
